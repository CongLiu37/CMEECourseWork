    Honey bee research is believed to be influenced dramatically by colony collapse disorder (CCD) and the sequenced genome release in 2006, but this assertion has never been tested. By employing text-mining approaches, research trends were tested by analyzing over 14,000 publications during the period of 1957 to 2017. Quantitatively, the data revealed an exponential growth until 2010 when the number of articles published per year ceased following the trend. Analysis of author-assigned keywords revealed that changes in keywords occurred roughly every decade with the most fundamental change in 1991–1992, instead of 2006. This change might be due to several factors including the research intensification on the Varroa mite. The genome release and CCD had quantitively only minor effects, mainly on honey bee health-related topics post-2006. Further analysis revealed that computational topic modeling can provide potentially hidden information and connections between some topics that might be ignored in author-assigned keywords.

    There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to €153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between €190 and €310 billion based upon average price elasticities of − 1.5 to − 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about €50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged €151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged €761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories – namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.

    Pollination plays a significant role in the agriculture sector and serves as a basic pillar for crop production. Plants depend on vectors to move pollen, which can include water, wind, and animal pollinators like bats, moths, hoverflies, birds, bees, butterflies, wasps, thrips, and beetles. Cultivated plants are typically pollinated by animals. Animal-based pollination contributes to 30% of global food production, and bee-pollinated crops contribute to approximately one-third of the total human dietary supply. Bees are considered significant pollinators due to their effectiveness and wide availability. Bee pollination provides excellent value to crop quality and quantity, improving global economic and dietary outcomes. This review highlights the role played by bee pollination, which influences the economy, and enlists the different types of bees and other insects associated with pollination.

    Many insect species provide essential pollination services. However, the amount of pollen deposited onto a stigma when visiting a flower (‘single visit pollen deposition’, SVD) can vary greatly among taxa depending on morphological traits of pollinators. Further, SVD is commonly measured using one of two methods (‘static’: waiting for an insect to visit a flower present on plant, and ‘active’: removing the flower and presenting it to a flower visitor) that may also differ in their effectiveness.
    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how SVD compares among pollinators, we conducted a hierarchical meta-analysis using data from 28 studies identified by a systematic review. These contained SVD data for 94 bee and 33 fly taxa (hereafter ‘wild pollinators’), across 30 plant species from which we included 127 observations. In the analysis of each study, we used the western honey bee Apis mellifera as a comparator species.
    Wild pollinators deposited more pollen onto stigmas per single visit than honeybees, and those with larger body deposited significantly more pollen than smaller ones. Of the two methodological approaches to assess SVD, ‘static’ versus ‘active’, we found no significant difference regarding the amount of deposited pollen.
    Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis highlights the breadth of wild pollinators that contribute to pollination effectiveness via their delivery of pollen to many crop and non-crop plant species. However, just 25% of the observations assessed the amount of pollen deposited by fly species. Our findings point to the need to further quantify the pollination effectiveness of non-bee pollinators as studies have largely focused on managed and wild bee species.

Habitat loss is the major threat to bee diversity, whilst invasive species, emerging diseases, pesticide use, and climate change also have the potential to impact bee populations. We suggest that future conservation strategies need to prioritise (i) minimising habitat loss, (ii) making agricultural habitats bee-friendly, (iii) training scientists and the public in bee taxonomy and identification, (iv) basic autecological and population genetic studies to underpin conservation strategies, (v) assessing the value of DNA barcoding for bee conservation, (vi) determining the impact of invasive plants, animals, parasites and pathogens, and (vii) integrating this information to understand the potential impact of climate change on current bee diversity.

    The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a species of crucial economic, agricultural and environmental importance. In the last ten years, some regions of the world have suffered from a significant reduction of honey bee colonies. In fact, honey bee losses are not an unusual phenomenon, but in many countries worldwide there has been a notable decrease in honey bee colonies. The cases in the USA, in many European countries, and in the Middle East have received considerable attention, mostly due to the absence of an easily identifiable cause. It has been difficult to determine the main factors leading to colony losses because of honey bees’ diverse social behavior. Moreover, in their daily routine, they make contact with many agents of the environment and are exposed to a plethora of human activities and their consequences. Nevertheless, various factors have been considered to be contributing to honey bee losses, and recent investigations have established some of the most important ones, in particular, pests and diseases, bee management, including bee keeping practices and breeding, the change in climatic conditions, agricultural practices, and the use of pesticides. The global picture highlights the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor as a major factor in colony loss. Last but not least, microsporidian parasites, mainly Nosema ceranae, also contribute to the problem. Thus, it is obvious that there are many factors affecting honey bee colony losses globally. Increased monitoring and scientific research should throw new light on the factors involved in recent honey bee colony losses. The present review focuses on the main factors which have been found to have an impact on the increase in honey bee colony losses.

As pollinators, bees are cornerstones for terrestrial ecosystem stability and key components in agricultural productivity. All animals, including bees, are associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the microbiome. The bee microbiome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further, the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the bee microbiome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment of the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated, and analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this end, the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would provide reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources. The goal would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing primary data from different research programs, thus furthering our understanding of the bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health.

    Unlike most other insects, honey bees possess a highly conserved and specialized core gut microbiome, which consists of nine bacterial species and is acquired mostly through social transmission. 
    Five of these species are ubiquitous in honey bees and are also present in bumble bees. 
    Recent studies have shown that the bee gut microbiome plays a role in metabolism, immune function, growth and development, and protection against pathogens. 
    Disruption of the gut microbiome has also been shown to have detrimental effects on bee health.

    Bees acquire carbohydrates from nectar and lipids; and amino acids from pollen, which also contains polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. These potential energy sources could be degraded and fermented through microbial enzymatic activity, resulting in short chain fatty acids available to hosts. However, the contributions of individual microbiota members to polysaccharide digestion have remained unclear. Through analysis of bacterial isolate genomes and a metagenome of the honey bee gut microbiota, we identify that Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella are the principal degraders of hemicellulose and pectin. Both Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella show extensive strain-level diversity in gene repertoires linked to polysaccharide digestion. Strains from honey bees possess more such genes than strains from bumble bees. In Bifidobacterium, genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are colocated within loci devoted to polysaccharide utilization, as in Bacteroides from the human gut. Carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding gene expressions are up-regulated in response to particular hemicelluloses both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomic analyses document that bees experimentally colonized by different strains generate distinctive gut metabolomic profiles, with enrichment for specific monosaccharides, corresponding to predictions from genomic data. The other 3 core gut species clusters (Snodgrassella and 2 Lactobacillus clusters) possess few or no genes for polysaccharide digestion. Together, these findings indicate that strain composition within individual hosts determines the metabolic capabilities and potentially affects host nutrition. Furthermore, the niche specialization revealed by our study may promote overall community stability in the gut microbiomes of bees.

    Honey bees are globally important plant pollinators. Guts of adult workers contain specialized bacteria not found outside bees. Experimental results show that gut bacteria increase weight gain in young adult bees, affect expression of genes governing insulin and vitellogenin levels, and increase sucrose sensitivity. Gut bacteria also shape the physicochemical conditions within the gut, lowering pH and oxygen levels. Peripheral resident bacteria consume oxygen, thus maintaining anoxia, as required for microbial activity. Additionally, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, with acetate and propionate as the major metabolites, as in guts of human and other animals. This study demonstrates how bacteria in the honey bee gut affect host weight gain and improves our understanding of how gut symbionts influence host health.

    Animals living in social communities typically harbor a characteristic gut microbiota important for nutrition and pathogen defense. Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a γ-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights into mutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.

    The honey bee, the world's most important agricultural pollinator, relies exclusively on plant-derived foods for nutrition. Nectar and pollen collected by honey bees are processed and matured within the nest through the activities of honey bee-derived microbes and enzymes. In order to better understand the contribution of the microbial community to food processing in the honey bee, we generated a metatranscriptome of the honey bee gut microbiome. The function of the microbial community in the honey bee, as revealed by metatranscriptome sequencing, resembles that of other animal guts and food-processing environments. We identified three major bacterial classes that are active in the gut (γ-Proteobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria), all of which are predicted to participate in the breakdown of complex macromolecules (e.g. polysaccharides and polypeptides), the fermentation of component parts of these macromolecules, and the generation of various fermentation products, such as short-chain fatty acids and alcohol. The ability of the microbial community to metabolize these carbon-rich food sources was confirmed through the use of community-level physiological profiling. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gut microflora of the honey bee harbours bacterial members with unique roles, which ultimately can contribute to the processing of plant-derived food for colonies.

    Although plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions have traditionally been studied separately, many traits are simultaneously under selection by both herbivores and pollinators. For example, secondary compounds commonly associated with herbivore defense have been found in the nectar of many plant species, and many plants produce nectar that is toxic or repellent to some floral visitors. Although secondary compounds in nectar and toxic nectar are geographically and phylogenetically widespread, their ecological significance is poorly understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the possible functions of toxic nectar, including encouraging specialist pollinators, deterring nectar robbers, preventing microbial degradation of nectar, and altering pollinator behavior. All of these hypotheses rest on the assumption that the benefits of toxic nectar must outweigh possible costs; however, to date no study has demonstrated that toxic nectar provides fitness benefits for any plant. Therefore, in addition to these adaptive hypotheses, we should also consider the hypothesis that toxic nectar provides no benefits or is tolerably detrimental to plants, and occurs due to previous selection pressures or pleiotropic constraints. For example, secondary compounds may be transported into nectar as a consequence of their presence in phloem, rather than due to direct selection for toxic nectar. Experimental approaches are necessary to understand the role of toxic nectar in plant-animal interactions.

    Populations of important pollinators, such as bumble bees and honey bees, are declining at alarming rates worldwide. Parasites are likely contributing to this phenomenon. A distinct resident community of bacteria has recently been identified in bumble bees and honey bees that is not shared with related solitary bee species. We now show that the presence of these microbiota protects bee hosts against a widespread and highly virulent natural parasite (Crithidia bombi) in an experimental setting. We add further support to this antagonistic relationship from patterns found in field data. For the successful establishment of these microbiota and a protective effect, exposure to feces from nest mates was needed after pupal eclosion. Transmission of beneficial gut bacteria could therefore represent an important benefit of sociality. Our results stress the importance of considering the host microbiota as an “extended immune phenotype” in addition to the host immune system itself and provide a unique perspective to understanding bees in health and disease.

Microbial community composition differed among bee species. Richness, defined as number of bacterial OTUs, was highest for B. bimaculatus and B. impatiens. For B. bimaculatus, this was due to high richness of non-core bacteria. We found little effect of habitat on microbial communities. Richness of non-core bacteria was negatively associated with bacterial abundance in individual bees, possibly due to deeper sampling of non-core bacteria in bees with low populations of core bacteria. Infection by the gut parasite Crithidia was negatively associated with abundance of the core bacterium Gilliamella and positively associated with richness of non-core bacteria. Our results indicate that Bombus species have distinctive gut communities, and community-level variation is associated with pathogen infection.

    Dysbiosis, defined as unhealthy shifts in bacterial community composition, can lower the colonization resistance of the gut to intrinsic pathogens. Here, we determined the effect of diet age and type on the health and bacterial community composition of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). We fed newly emerged bees fresh or aged diets, and then recorded host development and bacterial community composition from four distinct regions of the hosts’ digestive tract. Feeding fresh pollen or fresh substitute, we found no difference in host mortality, diet consumption, development or microbial community composition. In contrast, bees fed aged diets suffered impaired development, increased mortality and developed a significantly dysbiotic microbiome. The consumption of aged diets resulted in a significant reduction in the core ileum bacterium Snodgrassella alvi and a corresponding increase in intrinsic pathogen Frischella perrara. Moreover, the relative abundance of S. alvi in the ileum was positively correlated with host survival and development. The inverse was true for both F. perrara and Parasacharibacter apium. Collectively, our findings suggest that the early establishment of S. alvi is associated with healthy nurse development and potentially excludes F. perrara and P. apium from the ileum. Although at low abundance, establishment of the common midgut pathogen Nosema spp. was significantly associated with ileum dysbiosis and associated host deficiencies. Moreover, dysbiosis in the ileum was reflected in the rectum, mouthparts and hypopharyngeal glands, suggesting a systemic host effect. Our findings demonstrate that typically occurring alterations in diet quality play a significant role in colony health and the establishment of a dysbiotic gut microbiome.

    The human endogenous intestinal microflora is an essential “organ” in providing nourishment, regulating epithelial development, and instructing innate immunity; yet, surprisingly, basic features remain poorly described. We examined 13,355 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene sequences from multiple colonic mucosal sites and feces of healthy subjects to improve our understanding of gut microbial diversity. A majority of the bacterial sequences corresponded to uncultivated species and novel microorganisms. We discovered significant intersubject variability and differences between stool and mucosa community composition. Characterization of this immensely diverse ecosystem is the first step in elucidating its role in health and disease.

    Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our ability to detect and characterize the diversity and function of complex microbial communities. 
    In this review, we highlight the benefits of using metagenomics as well as the breadth of conclusions that can be made using currently available analytical tools, such as greater resolution of species and strains across phyla and functional content, while highlighting challenges of metagenomic data analysis. 
    Major challenges remain in annotating function, given the dearth of functional databases for environmental bacteria compared to model organisms, and the technical difficulties of metagenome assembly and phasing in heterogeneous environmental samples. 
    In the future, improvements and innovation in technology and methodology will lead to lowered costs. 
    Data integration using multiple technological platforms will lead to a better understanding of how to harness metagenomes. 
    Subsequently, we will be able not only to characterize complex microbiomes but also to manipulate communities to achieve prosperous outcomes for health, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.

    Diverse microbial communities of bacteria, archaea, viruses and single-celled eukaryotes have crucial roles in the environment and in human health. However, microbes are frequently difficult to culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of members and understanding of how communities function. High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of computational pipelines have been combined into shotgun metagenomics methods that have transformed microbiology. Still, computational approaches to overcome the challenges that affect both assembly-based and mapping-based metagenomic profiling, particularly of high-complexity samples or environments containing organisms with limited similarity to sequenced genomes, are needed. Understanding the functions and characterizing specific strains of these communities offers biotechnological promise in therapeutic discovery and innovative ways to synthesize products using microbial factories and can pinpoint the contributions of microorganisms to planetary, animal and human health.

    Most current approach to metagenomic classification employ short next generation sequencing (NGS) reads that are present in metagenomic samples to identify unique genomic regions. NGS reads, however, might not be long enough to differentiate similar genomes. This suggests a potential for using longer reads to improve classification performance. Presently, longer reads tend to have a higher rate of sequencing errors. Thus, given the pros and cons, it remains unclear which types of reads is better for metagenomic classification. We compared two taxonomic classification protocols: a traditional assembly-free protocol and a novel assembly-based protocol. The novel assembly-based protocol consists of assembling short-reads into longer reads, which will be subsequently classified by a traditional taxonomic classifier. We discovered that most classifiers made fewer predictions with longer reads and that they achieved higher classification performance on synthetic metagenomic data. Generally, we observed a significant increase in precision, while having similar recall rates. On real data, we observed similar characteristics that suggest that the classifiers might have similar performance of higher precision with similar recall with longer reads. We have shown a noticeable difference in performance between assembly-based and assembly-free taxonomic classification. This finding strongly suggests that classifying species in metagenomic environments can be achieved with higher overall performance simply by assembling short reads. Further, it also suggests that long-read technologies might be better for species classification.

    Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. 
    Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. 
    However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. 
    Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. 
    Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). 
    To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. 
    Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. 
    The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. 
    We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.

    Microorganisms and the viruses that infect them are the most numerous biological entities on Earth and enclose its greatest biodiversity and genetic reservoir. With strength in their numbers, these microscopic organisms are major players in the cycles of energy and matter that sustain all life. Scientists have only scratched the surface of this vast microbial world through culture-dependent methods. Recent developments in generating metagenomes, large random samples of nucleic acid sequences isolated directly from the environment, are providing comprehensive portraits of the composition, structure, and functioning of microbial communities. Moreover, advances in metagenomic analysis have created the possibility of obtaining complete or nearly complete genome sequences from uncultured microorganisms, providing important means to study their biology, ecology, and evolution. Here we review some of the recent developments in the field of metagenomics, focusing on the discovery of genetic novelty and on methods for obtaining uncultured genome sequences, including through the recycling of previously published datasets. Moreover we discuss how metagenomics has become a core scientific tool to characterize eco-evolutionary patterns of microbial ecosystems, thus allowing us to simultaneously discover new microbes and study their natural communities. We conclude by discussing general guidelines and challenges for modeling the interactions between uncultured microorganisms and viruses based on the information contained in their genome sequences. These models will significantly advance our understanding of the functioning of microbial ecosystems and the roles of microbes in the environment.

The MAGs comprised 1,522 species-level genome bins (SGBs), most of which were novel at the species, genus, or family level, and the majority were enriched in host versus environment metagenomes. Many traits distinguished SGBs enriched in host or environmental biomes, including the number of antimicrobial resistance genes. We identified 1,986 diverse biosynthetic gene clusters; only 23 clustered with any MIBiG database references. Gene-based assembly revealed tremendous gene diversity, much of it host or environment specific. Our MAG and gene data sets greatly expand the microbial genome repertoire and provide a broad view of microbial adaptations to the vertebrate gut.

    With the constant improvement in cost-efficiency and quality of Next Generation Sequencing technologies, shotgun-sequencing approaches -such as metagenomics- have nowadays become the methods of choice for studying and classifying microorganisms from various habitats. The production of data has dramatically increased over the past years and processing and analysis steps are becoming more and more of a bottleneck. Limiting factors are partly the availability of computational resources, but mainly the bioinformatics expertise in establishing and applying appropriate processing and analysis pipelines. Fortunately, a large diversity of specialized software tools is nowadays available. Nevertheless, choosing the most appropriate methods for answering specific biological questions can be rather challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians. In order to provide a comprehensive overview and guide for the microbiological scientific community, we assessed the most common and freely available metagenome assembly tools with respect to their output statistics, their sensitivity for low abundant community members and variability in resulting community profiles as well as their ease-of-use. In contrast to the highly anticipated "Critical Assessment of Metagenomic Interpretation" (CAMI) challenge, which uses general mock community-based assembler comparison we here tested assemblers on real Illumina metagenome sequencing data from natural communities of varying complexity sampled from forest soil and algal biofilms. Our observations clearly demonstrate that different assembly tools can prove optimal, depending on the sample type, available computational resources and, most importantly, the specific research goal. In addition, we present detailed descriptions of the underlying principles and pitfalls of publically available assembly tools from a microbiologist’s perspective, and provide guidance regarding the user-friendliness, sensitivity and reliability of the resulting phylogenetic profiles.

MetaQUAST addresses such metagenome datasets features as (i) unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference sequences, (ii) huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple genomes and (iii) presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs. We demonstrate MetaQUAST performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real datasets.

    Honey bees are considered large-scale monitoring tools due to their environmental exploration and foraging activities. Traces of these activities can be recovered in the honey that also may reflect the hive ecological micro-conditions in which it has been produced. This study applied a next generation sequencing platform (Ion Torrent) for shotgun metagenomic analysis of honey environmental DNA (eDNA). The study tested a methodological framework to interpret DNA sequence information useful to describe the complex ecosystems of the honey bee colony superorganism, its pathosphere and the heterogeneity of the agroecological environments and environmental sources that left DNA marks in the honey. Analysis of two honeys reported sequence reads from five main organism groups (kingdoms or phyla): arthropods (that mainly included reads from Apis mellifera, several other members of the Hymenotpera, in addition to members of the Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, as well as aphids and mites), plants (that clearly confirmed the botanical origin of the two honeys, i.e. orange tree blossom and eucalyptus tree blossom honeys), fungi and bacteria (including common hive and honey bee gut microorganisms, honey bee pathogens and plant pathogens), and viruses (which accounted for the largest number of reads in both honeys, mainly assigned to Apis mellifera filamentous virus). The shotgun metagenomic approach that was used in this study can be applied in large scale experiments that might have multiple objectives according to the multi-kingdom derived eDNA that is contained in the honey.

    Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome. Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, HUMAnN, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal pH) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the HMP cohort and in future metagenomic studies.

    Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.

    Obtaining an unbiased view of the phylogenetic composition and functional diversity within a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs, to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more-focused assessments of the phylogenetic (e.g., 16S rRNA genes) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short (∼100 to 200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for the phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities, the results of BLAST and COG analyses were compared for long (∼750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, BLASTX searches against the GenBank nr database found far fewer homologs within the short-sequence libraries. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short-read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in BLASTX homolog detection. Only in cases where the long-read sequence had a close homolog (low BLAST E-score) did the derived short-read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more-distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short-read sequences. Among COG hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72% of the COG hits found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for the analysis of short sequences, the use of short-read-length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for the metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.

    To assess the functional capacities of microbial communities, including those inhabiting the human body, shotgun metagenomic reads are often aligned to a database of known genes. Such homology-based annotation practices critically rely on the assumption that short reads can map to orthologous genes of similar function. This assumption, however, and the various factors that impact short read annotation, have not been systematically evaluated. To address this challenge, we generated an extremely large database of simulated reads (totaling 15.9 Gb), spanning over 500,000 microbial genes and 170 curated genomes and including, for many genomes, every possible read of a given length. We annotated each read using common metagenomic protocols, fully characterizing the effect of read length, sequencing error, phylogeny, database coverage, and mapping parameters. We additionally rigorously quantified gene-, genome-, and protocol-specific annotation biases. Overall, our findings provide a first comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of functional metagenomic annotation, providing crucial goal-specific best-practice guidelines to inform future metagenomic research.

    Metagenomics analysis revealing the composition and functional repertoire of complex microbial communities typically relies on large amounts of sequence data. Numerous analysis strategies and computational tools are available for their analysis. Fully integrated automated analysis pipelines such as MG-RAST or MEGAN6 are user-friendly but not designed for integrating specific knowledge on the biological system under study. In order to facilitate the consideration of such knowledge, we introduce a modular, adaptable analysis pipeline combining existing tools. We applied the novel pipeline to simulated mock data sets focusing on anaerobic digestion microbiomes and compare results to those obtained with established automated analysis pipelines. We find that the analysis strategy and choice of tools and parameters have a strong effect on the inferred taxonomic community composition, but not on the inferred functional profile. By including prior knowledge, computational costs can be decreased while improving result accuracy. While automated off-the-shelf analysis pipelines are easy to apply and require no knowledge on the microbial system under study, custom-made pipelines require more preparation time and bioinformatics expertise. This extra effort is minimized by our modular, flexible, custom-made pipeline, which can be adapted to different scenarios and can take available knowledge on the microbial system under study into account.

Here, we evaluated the impact of a wide range of amounts of host DNA and sequencing depths on microbiome taxonomic profiling using WMS. Synthetic samples with increasing levels of host DNA were created by spiking DNA of a mock bacterial community, with DNA from a mouse-derived cell line. Taxonomic analysis revealed that increasing proportions of host DNA led to decreased sensitivity in detecting very low and low abundant species. Reduction of sequencing depth had major impact on the sensitivity of WMS for profiling samples with 90% host DNA, increasing the number of undetected species. Finally, analysis of simulated datasets with fixed depth of 10 million reads confirmed that microbiome profiling becomes more inaccurate as the level of host DNA increases in a sample. In conclusion, samples with high amounts of host DNA coupled with reduced sequencing depths, decrease WMS coverage for characterization of the microbiome. This study highlights the importance of carefully considering these aspects in the design of WMS experiments to maximize microbiome analyses.

    Shotgun metagenomics sequencing is a powerful tool for the characterization of complex biological matrices, enabling analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and viruses in a single experiment, with the possibility of reconstructing de novo the whole metagenome or a set of genes of interest. 
    One of the main factors limiting the use of shotgun metagenomics on wide scale projects is the high cost associated with the approach. 
    We set out to determine if it is possible to use shallow shotgun metagenomics to characterize complex biological matrices while reducing costs. 
    We used a staggered mock community to estimate the optimal threshold for species detection. 
    We measured the variation of several summary statistics simulating a decrease in sequencing depth by randomly subsampling a number of reads. 
    The main statistics that were compared are diversity estimates, species abundance, and ability of reconstructing de novo the metagenome in terms of length and completeness. 
    Our results show that diversity indices of complex prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral communities can be accurately estimated with 500,000 reads or less, although particularly complex samples may require 1,000,000 reads. 
    On the contrary, any task involving the reconstruction of the metagenome performed poorly, even with the largest simulated subsample (1,000,000 reads). 
    The length of the reconstructed assembly was smaller than the length obtained with the full dataset, and the proportion of conserved genes that were identified in the meta-genome was drastically reduced compared to the full sample. 
    Shallow shotgun metagenomics can be a useful tool to describe the structure of complex matrices, but it is not adequate to reconstruct—even partially—the metagenome.

    Developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have rapidly advanced the understanding of overall microbial ecology as well as occurrence and diversity of specific genes within diverse environments. 
    In the present study, we compared the ability of varying sequencing depths to generate meaningful information about the taxonomic structure and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the bovine fecal microbial community. 
    Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on eight composite fecal samples originating from four beef cattle feedlots. 
    Metagenomic DNA was sequenced to various depths, D1, D0.5 and D0.25, with average sample read counts of 117, 59 and 26 million, respectively. 
    A comparative analysis of the relative abundance of reads aligning to different phyla and antimicrobial classes indicated that the relative proportions of read assignments remained fairly constant regardless of depth. 
    However, the number of reads being assigned to ARGs as well as to microbial taxa increased significantly with increasing depth. We found a depth of D0.5 was suitable to describe the microbiome and resistome of cattle fecal samples. 
    This study helps define a balance between cost and required sequencing depth to acquire meaningful results.

    Background
    Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. 
    There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. 
    In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. 
    We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). 
    Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. 
    To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, ‘ResPipe’.
    
    Results
    Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 
    1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. 
    However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. 
    Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. 
    While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.

    Conclusions
    Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. 
    Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. 
    Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database. 
    ResPipe, the open-source software pipeline we have developed, is freely available (https://gitlab.com/hsgweon/ResPipe).

    In this paper a methodology is presented for measuring diversity based on rarefaction of actual samples. By the use of this technique, a within-habitat analysis was made of the bivalve and polychaete components of soft-bottom marine faunas which differed in latitude, depth, temperature, and salinity. The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.

    The recent literature on species diversity contains many semantic, conceptual, and technical problems. It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species—number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or "species composition parameters" having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ▵1=[n/n—1][1—Σi(N_i/_N)2] =the proportion of potential interindividual encounters which is interspecific (as opposed to intraspecific), assuming every individual in the collection can encounter all other individuals, E(Sn) = Σi [1—(N—Nin)/(Nn)] =the expected number of species in a sample of n individuals selected at random from a collection containing N individuals, S species, and Ni individuals in the ith species.

    Fish species richness is an important indicator of river ecological condition but it is particularly difficult to estimate in large unwadeable rapidly flowing rivers. Intensive multi-gear sampling is time consuming, logistically complex and expensive. However, insufficient sampling effort underestimates species richness and yields inaccurate data about the ecological condition of river sites. We raft-electrofished 10 large river sites in 10 different ecoregions and six western USA states for distances equal to 300 times their mean wetted channel widths (MCWs) to estimate the effort needed to approach asymptotes in fish species richness. To collect 90% of the observed fish species at the sites, we found that an average of 150 MCWs (ranging 80–210 MCWs) were needed, with the number of MCWs increasing in rivers with a higher proportion of spatially rare species. Frequently, the second or third additional 100 MCWs produced only one or two additional singletons or doubletons (species occurring only once or twice at a site). Before initiating sampling programs for estimating species richness, we recommend assessing sampling effort, particularly if rare or uncommon species are expected or desired.

  abstract = {
    While conservation planning requires good biodiversity data, our knowledge of most
    living groups is scarce and patchy even in well-sampled regions. 
    Therefore, we need methodologies for rapid assessments for particular groups and regions. 
    Maps of any biodiversity surrogate can be interpolated from even a few well-known sites, but such places are usually lacking. 
    We therefore propose a protocol for designing field surveys to obtain good coverage of pattern variations of biodiversity in a given region. 
    To represent biodiversity patterns comprehensively, we use a rule step site-allocation procedure, partially based on Faith and Walker’s ED criterion that takes environmental and spatial variation into account, together with other criteria such as survey costs.
    A preliminary assessment of the adequacy of this site sampling strategy is made. 
    Then a set of complementary sites is selected for further sampling. 
    Using the ED criterion, during the stepwise process a p-median analysis is applied both to an environmental distance matrix and to a spatial distance matrix, to maximize the amount of variation covered by our survey planning. 
    This rule-set allocation procedure is integrated into a continuous sampling design protocol directed to ensure we can sample all biodiversity of a region. 
    This protocol requires the gathering of both biological and environmental information, an assessment of previously available information, the choice of sampling methods and dates, and a continuous assessment of the success of the survey being carried out. 
    An example of the application of this protocol to the survey design of dung beetle (Coleoptera,
    Scarabaeoidea) diversity in the Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) is included.

  abstract = {
    In this study we used species accumulation models to solve one of the most serious problems encountered when comparing species richness between different communities.
    The problem is how to compare data among inventories in which different methodologies or measures of sampling effort have been employed. 
    The methods used here for bats may be applied to any other biological group. 
    We fit two asymptotic models to species accumulation curves for bat inventories to evaluate local or within-community diversity (alpha) and landscape diversity (gamma) in central Veracruz, Mexico.

    Species accumulation models allow us to: (i) measure within-inventory efficacy and completeness; (ii) obtain an estimate of species richness that is based on a standardized measure of sampling effort, which makes valid comparisons between inventories possible; and (iii) estimate the minimum sampling effort required to reach a satisfactory level of completeness.

    The applied models fit well in all cases (r^2 > 0.95). 
    The linear dependence model predicted lower asymptotes and the Clench model predicted higher asymptotes than the observed species richness. 
    These models are useful as predictors representing the lower and upper limits between which the true species richness value should lie.

    Alpha diversity for bats in all vegetation communities (11–18 species) was lower than the gamma diversity (20 species), suggesting that species richness and the sampling effort required are related to environmental heterogeneity.

    We propose that 90% of the total fauna predicted by either of the models is an acceptable standardized value for comparing species richness between communities.

    We assessed the within-inventory completeness as the proportion of the models’ asymptote, where 90% is the desired minimum level of completeness. 
    Except in palm stands, all bat inventories had an acceptable level of completeness, at least for the linear dependence model.

    For conditions similar to those of our study area, the minimum effort required to obtain a satisfactory level of completeness is 5–18 nights for plant communities and 18 nights for more heterogeneous landscapes.

    We make recommendations for improving the efficacy and completeness of bat surveys based on the application of species accumulation models.

    The selection of the most appropriate model is essential to predict the potential species richness of a site or landscape. 
    Species accumulation curves have been used as a basic tool for comparing richness when different sampling protocols have been applied. 
    Among the parameters generated by these models the slope has been cited as an indicator of completeness without regard to a defined cut-off value. 
    In this work, we fit 12 field data sets of aquatic Coleoptera (Hidalgo) and Odonata larvae (Michoacán) to 2 asymptotic models (Clench and Linear Dependence) in order to calculate the slopes at the maximum effort and relate them with efficiency. 
    Then, the theoretical effort needed to achieve the 95% of the lists was calculated for each data set in order to get the theoretical slopes. 
    The average slope value found was 0.01 with a variance of <0.001, so we propose this value as indicative of a list reaching 95% of completeness for data obtained from similar sampling protocols. 
    Additionally, we propose the use of number of rare species as an additional criterion to evaluate the inventories completeness. 
    The effect of different sampling intensity on fitted models and estimation of parameters and the importance of a cut-off slope value in asymptotic models as a criterion to evaluate completeness of biological inventories are discussed.

    A three-step protocol described elsewhere is used to obtain a map of butterfly species density in Portugal on a 50×50 km grid. First, all available faunistic information was compiled and analysed to explore the historic patterns of butterfly sampling in Portugal, and to determine which grid cells are sufficiently prospected to produce reliable estimates of species richness. Then, we relate the estimated species richness scores from these areas to a set of environmental and spatial variables by means of General Linear Models, obtaining a function to extrapolate of species density scores to the rest of Portugal. Finally, the model is validated, results explored and outliers identified and deleted. Any spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals is examined. Lastly, model parameters are recalculated in absence of deleted outliers, and the resulting function is used to predict species richness scores throughout mainland Portugal. A highly-predictive function based on some variables previously related to butterfly composition at macro-scale, such as number of sunny days per year, temperature or environmental heterogeneity, was obtained. However, in Portugal those variables are highly spatially structured along a steep latitudinal gradient, leading to difficulty in ascertaining if the latitudinal gradient detected by our analysis is due to macroecological or historic effects. Information on European and Iberian butterfly assemblages and causal processes are discussed in the light of the patterns observed. Then, previous information obtained on Portuguese scarabs is added to identify conservation areas, biogeographically important for both insect groups. Finally, the main drawbacks and advantages of this approach to mapping biodiversity for conservation are discussed briefly.

    With the growing capacity to inventory microbial community diversity, the need for statistical methods to compare community inventories is also growing. Several approaches have been proposed for comparing the diversity of microbial communities: some adapted from traditional ecology and others designed specifically for molecular inventories of microbes. Rarefaction is one statistical method that is commonly applied in microbial studies, and this chapter discusses the procedure and its advantages and disadvantages. Rarefaction compares observed taxon richness at a standardized sampling effort using confidence intervals. Special emphasis is placed here on the need for precise, rather than unbiased, estimation methods in microbial ecology, but precision can be judged only with a very large sample or with multiple samples drawn from a single community. With low sample sizes, rarefaction curves also have the potential to lead to incorrect rankings of relative species richness, but this chapter discusses a new method with the potential to address this problem. Finally, this chapter shows how rarefaction can be applied to the comparison of the taxonomic similarity of microbial communities.

    The honey bee gut microbiota influences bee health and has
become an important model to study the ecology and evolution of
microbiota–host interactions. Yet, little is known about the phage
community associated with the bee gut, despite its potential to
modulate bacterial diversity or to govern important symbiotic func-
tions. Here we analyzed two metagenomes derived from virus-like
particles, analyzed the prevalence of the identified phages across 73
bacterial metagenomes from individual bees, and tested the host
range of isolated phages. Our results show that the honey bee gut
virome is composed of at least 118 distinct clusters corresponding to
both temperate and lytic phages and representing novel genera
with a large repertoire of unknown gene functions. We find that
the phage community is prevalent in honey bees across space and
time and targets the core members of the bee gut microbiota. The
large number and high genetic diversity of the viral clusters seems
to mirror the high extent of strain-level diversity in the bee gut
microbiota. We isolated eight lytic phages that target the core
microbiota member Bifidobacterium asteroides, but that exhibited
different host ranges at the strain level, resulting in a nested in-
teraction network of coexisting phages and bacterial strains. Collec-
tively, our results show that the honey bee gut virome consists of a
complex and diverse phage community that likely plays an impor-
tant role in regulating strain-level diversity in the bee gut and that
holds promise as an experimental model to study bacteria–phage
dynamics in natural microbial communities.

In the haemolymph of infected bees which showed no clinical symptoms the percentage of oval plasmatocytes was higher (P ≤ 0.05), while the percentage of round plasmatocytes was lower (P ≤ 0.05) 10 h after infection. The above changes were also observed in diseased bees independently of the time of clinical manifestation. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in the percentage of granulocytes and mitotically dividing haemocytes between diseased and control bees. The percentage of degenerated and/or dead haemocytes was higher in the haemolymph of diseased bees.

  abstract = {
    Twenty two distinct bacteriophages were isolated from sewage water from five locations in the city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire over a two-year period, using a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with diverse genotypes. The phages were characterized by their virulence spectrum on a panel of selected P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and by whole genome sequencing. Twelve virions representing the observed diversity were visualised by electron microscopy. The combined observations showed that 17 phages, distributed into seven genera, were virulent, and that five phages were related to temperate phages belonging to three genera. Some showed similarity with known phages only at the protein level. The vast majority of the genetic variations among virulent phages from the same genus resulted from seemingly non-random horizontal transfer events, inside a population of P. aeruginosa phages with limited diversity. This suggests the existence of a single environmental reservoir or ecotype in which continuous selection is taking place. In contrast, mostly point mutations were observed among phages potentially capable of lysogenisation. This is the first study of P. aeruginosa phage diversity in an African city and it shows that a large variety of phage species can be recovered in a limited geographical site at least when different bacterial strains are used. The relative temporal and spatial stability of the Abidjan phage population might reflect equilibrium in the microbial community from which they are released.

  abstract = {
    Bees are associated with a remarkable diversity of microorganisms, including unicellular parasites, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The application of next-generation sequencing approaches enables the identification of this rich species composition as well as the discovery of previously unknown associations. Using high-throughput polyadenylated ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, we investigated the metatranscriptome of eight wild bee species (Andrena cineraria, Andrena fulva, Andrena haemorrhoa, Bombus terrestris, Bombus cryptarum, Bombus pascuorum, Osmia bicornis, and Osmia cornuta) sampled from four different localities in Belgium. Across the RNA sequencing libraries, 88–99% of the taxonomically informative reads were of the host transcriptome. Four viruses with homology to insect pathogens were found including two RNA viruses (belonging to the families Iflaviridae and Tymoviridae that harbor already viruses of honey bees), a double stranded DNA virus (family Nudiviridae) and a single stranded DNA virus (family Parvoviridae). In addition, we found genomic sequences of 11 unclassified arthropod viruses (related to negeviruses, sobemoviruses, totiviruses, rhabdoviruses, and mononegaviruses), seven plant pathogenic viruses, and one fungal virus. Interestingly, nege-like viruses appear to be widespread, host-specific, and capable of attaining high copy numbers inside bees. Next to viruses, three novel parasite associations were discovered in wild bees, including Crithidia pragensis and a tubulinosematid and a neogregarine parasite. Yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia were identified in solitary bees. This study gives a glimpse of the microorganisms and viruses associated with social and solitary wild bees and demonstrates that their diversity exceeds by far the subset of species first discovered in honey bees.

Ovoid viral particles seen in diseased bee hemolymph consisted of a folded nucleocapsid within a viral envelope and were 0.40 by 0.10 μm. Virions with unfolded nucleocapsids were about 3060 by 60 nm. The disease was transmissible to bees both per os and by injection, but efforts to infect oriental cockroaches, Blatta orientalis, and the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, failed. The disease is apparently the same as that described as a rickettsial disease of European bees.

    Parvoviridae, a diverse family of small single-stranded DNA viruses was established in 1975. It was divided into two subfamilies, Parvovirinae and Densovirinae, in 1993 to accommodate parvoviruses that infect vertebrate and invertebrate animals, respectively. This relatively straightforward segregation, using host association as the prime criterion for subfamily-level classification, has recently been challenged by the discovery of divergent, vertebrate-infecting parvoviruses, dubbed “chapparvoviruses”, which have proven to be more closely related to viruses in certain Densovirinae genera than to members of the Parvovirinae. Viruses belonging to these genera, namely Brevi-, Hepan- and Penstyldensovirus, are responsible for the unmatched heterogeneity of the subfamily Densovirinae when compared to the Parvovirinae in matters of genome organization, protein sequence homology, and phylogeny. Another genus of Densovirinae, Ambidensovirus, has challenged traditional parvovirus classification, as it includes all newly discovered densoviruses with an ambisense genome organization, which introduces genus-level paraphyly. Lastly, current taxon definition and virus inclusion criteria have significantly limited the classification of certain long-discovered parvoviruses and impedes the classification of some potential family members discovered using high-throughput sequencing methods. Here, we present a new and updated system for parvovirus classification, which includes the introduction of a third subfamily, Hamaparvovirinae, resolves the paraphyly within genus Ambidensovirus, and introduces new genera and species into the subfamily Parvovirinae. These proposals were accepted by the ICTV in 2020 March.

The honey bee adds a relevant study system due to the simplicity and experimental tractability of its gut microbiota, but also because bees are important pollinators that suffer from population declines worldwide. The use of gnotobiotic bees combined with genetic tools, ‘omics’ analysis, and experimental microbiology has recently provided important insights about the impact of the microbiota on bee health and the general functioning of gut ecosystems.

  abstract = {
    A ‘metagenome’ is the theoretical collection of genomes from all members of a given microbial community, and a ‘metagenomic data set’ is the subset captured in a given sequencing event. Although these terms are often used interchangeably and metagenomic data sets are regularly called metagenomes by synecdoche, their relationship is analogous to sample and population in statistics. The fraction of the metagenome represented in the metagenomic data set, termed coverage (not to be confused with the repetition of features, termed sequencing depth), is of key importance in assessing statistical significance of features sampled (taxa, genes and so on). However, quantitative computational methods to assess the level of coverage are limited, a problem we have recently attempted to solve. In extreme cases, where small data sets are used to characterize complex communities, misleading inferences can arise. For instance, random variation can be frequently mistaken for real differences in comparisons of metagenomic data sets with extreme differences in coverage. Further, insufficient coverage also reduces the detection limits and statistical power of the comparisons, hiding real, ecologically relevant trends and differences (Figure 1). We demonstrate here how available solutions can determine the level of sequencing coverage obtained by metagenomic data sets and thus, guide their robust analysis and comparison.
