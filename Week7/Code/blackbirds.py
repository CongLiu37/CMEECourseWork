# You may want to make other changes to the text. 

# In particular, note that there are "strange characters" (these are accents and
# non-ascii symbols) because we don't care for them, first transform to ASCII:

text = text.encode('ascii', 'ignore') # first encode into ascii bytes
text = text.decode('ascii', 'ignore') # Now decode back to string

# Now extend this script so that it captures the Kingdom, Phylum and Species
# name for each species and prints it out to screen neatly.

#Regular expressions for names of kindom, phylum and species
kingdom = r"(Kingdom\s\w+)"
phylum = r"(Phylum\s\w+)"
species = r"(Species\s\w+\s\w+)"

#Match regular expressions to text
k = re.findall(kingdom, text)
p = re.findall(phylum, text)
s = re.findall(species, text)

#Print kindoms, pylum and species
for i in range(0,len(k)):
    print(k[i])
    print(p[i])
    print(s[i])
    print("\n")

# Hint: you may want to use re.findall(my_reg, text)... Keep in mind that there
# are multiple ways to skin this cat! Your solution could involve multiple
# regular expression calls (slightly easier!), or a single one (slightly harder!)
